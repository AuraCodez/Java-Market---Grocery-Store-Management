# GroceryStore
My Object Oriented Program design and implementation of a store in Java.

My project is a program that is catered towards an implementation of some grocery store (But all stores can use this). It's useful because it can potentially help store owners keep tracking of the items they may have in stock and calculate the prices and quantity of the items. 

Features

    -Add new items to the store with a name, price, and stock quantity
    -Remove items from the store by name
    -Increase or decrease the stock quantity of an item
    -Get the total price of all items in the store
    -Search for an item by name using binary search
    -Display a list of all items in the store

I am not quite done with this project fully, I am always working towards making new updates and fixing problems when I see them.
