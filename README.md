# GroceryStore
Object Oriented Program implementation of a grocery store.

My project is a program that helps grocery store owners/store owners manage their stores. It allows them to track the items they have in stock, calculate prices and quantities, and potentially assist with other tasks related to store management. Lots of useful commands added for store owners to use.

The program is implemented using object-oriented programming in Java, and consists of two main classes: the Item class, which represents the products that the store sells, and the GroceryStore class, which represents the store itself. There is also an employee class, which are the employees that work in the store.

 - I am currently making an GUI for this project (Using Java Swing) so that everyone can use it easily, instead of it being a console application.
 - I also want to make the program save the employee information for the next time the program is run, which requires the usage of some file or database such as MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite.
