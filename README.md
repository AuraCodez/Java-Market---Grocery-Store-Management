# GroceryStore
My Object Oriented Program design and implementation of a store in Java. Three classes consist of : Employees, Item, GroceryStore

My  project is a software application designed to help grocery store owners and managers keep track of their inventory and pricing. It provides useful features such as the ability to add and remove items, update stock levels, and calculate the total price of all goods in the store. This can help store owners stay organized and efficiently manage their operations. In addition, the program can be easily customized and used by any type of store, not just grocery stores.

Main Features

   - Add new items to the store with a name, price, and stock quantity
   - Remove items from the store by name
   - Increase or decrease the stock quantity of an item
   - Get the total price of all items in the store
   - Search for an item by name using binary search
   - Display a list of all items in the store
 

There are a few improvements I would like to make soon

   - Add the ability to update the price of an item
   - Implement sorting the list of items by name or price
   - Add validation to ensure that the stock quantity is never negative
   - Allow the user to specify the name and price when adding a new item, rather than hardcoding them in the main method
   - Develop a GUI in Java swing so that this program can have an interface in which people anyone can easily use
